## Git

:::callout{.warning.minimal}
**Take note!**

You may have interacted with Git through GUIs like Github Desktop, GitKraken, and SourceTree. However, git-mastery prefers the use of the Git CLI as you are usually able to perform more complex commands directly through the CLI.
:::

::::::::steps
:::::::step{title="Verification"}

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git version
```

The following text confirms that Git is installed.

```bash
git version 2.48.1
```

If Git is already installed, feel free to skip to the next section of [setting up Github](./learning-lab/setup#github).

## Github

::::::::steps

:::::::step{title="New account"}
Create a [new Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) _if you donâ€™t have an account_
:::::::

:::::::step{title="Verification"}
Verify if you already have SSH setup for Github:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you have already set it up, you should see a message containing your username. If so, feel free to skip to installing [Github CLI](/learning-lab/setup#github-cli).
:::::::

:::::::step{title="SSH setup"}

::::::steps
:::::step{title="Verify existing SSH key"}
Run the following command to list the files in your `~/.ssh/` folder (including hidden files).

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you have an existing SSH key, you will see one of the following entries:

- `id_rsa.pub`
- `id_ecdsa.pub`
- `id_ed25519.pub`

If you already have an existing SSH key, you can skip the next two steps.
:::::

:::::step{title="Create an SSH key"}
Create a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your email"
```

::::callout{.info.minimal}
You can press **Enter** to accept all of the defaults (including using an empty passphrase).
::::

:::::

:::::step{title="Add SSH key to ssh-agent"}

Add the private SSH key to the `ssh-agent`.

For more information about each step, refer to the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=mac#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent).

::::tabs{key=os-all}
:::tab{key=macos header="MacOS"}

Start the `ssh-agent` in the background.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

You should get the following output.

```bash
> Agent pid ...
```

If you are using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, modify your `~/.ssh/config` to automatically load keys into the `ssh-agent`.

Check if that you have `~/.ssh/config` on your machine:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/config
```

If you see the following error, run the next command:

```bash
cat: ~/.ssh/config: No such file or directory
```

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

Edit the file to include the following at the end of the file:

```bash
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:

```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

:::

:::tab{key=windows header="Windows"}

In an admin elevated PowerShell window, start the `ssh-agent`:

```powershell
Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
Start-Service ssh-agent
```

Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

:::

:::tab{key=linux header="Linux"}

Start the `ssh-agent` in the background.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

You should get the following output.

```bash
> Agent pid ...
```

Add your SSH private key to the `ssh-agent`:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

:::

::::

:::::

:::::step{title="Add SSH key to Github"}

Once done, you can add the SSH key to Github.

Copy the public SSH key (ending with `.pub`) to your clipboard:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

In Github, go to **your settings > "Access" > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**.

Give it a readable name and paste the contents of your public SSH key.

:::::

:::::step{title="Verify Github SSH"}

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Verify that the fingerprint in the message matches [Github's public key fingerprint](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints) and if it does, type `yes`.

You should see a message containing your username:

```bash
Hi <your username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not pr
ovide shell access.
```

:::::

:::::::

:::::::step{title="Configurations"}

To use Git with Github, you will require the following configurations:

::::::steps

:::::step{title="Configuring name"}
Set the name associated with your Git commits.

This name will be visible in any future commits pushed to Github from the command line.

You can use any text if you wish to keep your real name private.

For more information, refer to the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/setting-your-username-in-git).

```bash
git config --global user.name "<your name>"
```

:::::

:::::step{title="Configuring email"}
Set the email to be associated with your Git commits.

Similar to setting your name, if you wish to keep your real email private, you can do so using a Github-provided `noreply` email as [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github).

```bash

:::
:::::::

:::::::step{title="Verification"}

You can verify that the setup for the Github CLI worked by running the following:

```bash
gh auth status
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```bash
